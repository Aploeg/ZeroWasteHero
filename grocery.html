      <p>For those of you considering moving to a zero-waste lifestyle, the
        biggest consideration you might have in London is... how do I do my
        food shopping?? With a proliferation of grocery stores in London focusing
        on <em>convenience</em> rather than our planet, making the move can seem
        daunting.
      <br>
      <br>
        Never fear! We've compiled a list of our favorite shops for bulk
        shopping! Now gather up your jars, sacks, bottles, and reusable shopping
        totes and hit the road!
      <br>
      <br>
        This is not the most extensive zero waste shopping guide available,
        nor the one with the most information (for that I like the <a
        href="http://eco-boost.co/where-to-buy-bulk-in-london/"
        target="_blank" class="shoutout">eco boost</a> post on the subject), but
        we think it could be a good start.</p>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Most Common</h2>
      <h3>Planet Organic</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.planetorganic.com" target="_blank">Planet Organic</a>
         has become our go-to all-purpose grocery shop, especially as we are
       lucky enough to have one in the neighborhood.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Dry goods, like rice, porridge, nuts, and
        lentils.  Also can get baking chocolate!  We like that we can weigh our
        goods and containers seamlessly to mke the checkout process efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Room for improvement</strong>: While the goods you get are packaging-
        free, which we applaud, we have noticed that they refill their bins with
        good that often come to them in plastic.  We want to minimize all
        packaging but especially plastic.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Most International</h2>
      <h3>Whole Foods</h3>
      <p>While we don't normally advocate Amazon as a zero-waste hero, Whole
        Foods was into bulk shopping <em>before</em> it was cool.  The mega-store
        in South Ken is the place to go to be filled with child-like wonder, and
        also for bulk flours, beans, and grind-your-own peanut butter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Pasta, beans, grains, and peanut butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Room for improvement</strong>: We prefer to shop local if we
        can, and Whole Foods has burned us in the past when it comes to bringing
        our own containers, leading to stress at the checkout line.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Best Shop for Spices</h2>
      <h3>Earth Natural Foods</h3>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.earthnaturalfoods.co.uk" target="_blank">
      Kentish Town natural foods store</a> has a delightful array of dry
      goods sold by weight, including a selection of beans and <em>!!!</em>
      wholemeal pasta.  What I love most about it though is their spice wall
      and the aura of good feeling that permeates the shop.  The checkout
      process can be a bit long but it's a great place to visit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Spices, pasta, more unusual grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Room for imporovement</strong>: Checkout efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Most Plastic-Free</h2>
      <h3>Hetu</h3>
      <p>This <a href="http://www.hetu.co.uk" target="_blank">utopian vegan plastic-free
      bulk shop</a> is dreamy.  Tiny, and located South of the River in Clapham
      Junction, they have a rotating stock, but generally a good selection of
      staples and treats.  In addition to dry goods and spices, they also carry
      maple syrup and plastic-free accessories, like bamboo compostable toothbrushes.
      Chat with the owner if she's around, she is full of zero waste tips
      and knows her way around the London plastic-free scene.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best for</strong>: surprising yourself (I've found bulgar
        wheat, soybeans, pasta and other things) - the stock changes so it's best
        to go without a firm list in  mind.  You can also use jars from their
        stock if you didn't bring enough.</p>
        <li><strong>Room for improvement</strong>: I'll let you know if I can
        think of anything.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Most Anticipated</h2>
      <h3>Bulk Market</h3>
      <p>Starting as a pop-up shop on Hackney, this <a href="https://www.bulkmarket.uk">
      zero waste full-service grocery store</a> promises to have it all, including
      beer, wine, and a community composting scheme.  We visited while it was
      still a pop-up shop and it was delightful... now if it would just open!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Dry good staples and a zero waste
        community.</li>
        <li><strong>Room for Improvement</strong>: We'll see.</li>

      <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
      <h3>Where to Buy Specialty Goods</h3>
      <p>For us, buying things like coffee and wine are also important and
      we were delighted to find some zero-waste gems that suit our purposes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monmouth Coffee</strong>: With a few locations, this
          top-notch coffee roaster is happy to fill a bag for you with
          freshly roasted coffee beans (wholebean or ground).  They also
          sell ceramic V60 pour-over cones if you want to go minimalist
          for coffee prep.</li>
        <li><strong>Made in Little France</strong>: This wine shop in Angel
          has red, white, and ros√© on tap and allows you to fill your own
          containers as long as they have legal measurements on them.  They also
          sell wine bottles you can come back and refill over and over.  The wine
          is good and the price is right!</li>
      </ul>
