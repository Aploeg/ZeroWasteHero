      <p>We moved to London from the U.S. in 2016 and starting moving towards a
        zero-waste lifestyle in 2017 after reading Bea Johnson's <a
        href="https://amzn.to/2qlfa6C" target="_blank">Zero Waste Home</a>.
        After a lot of online research, we were able to reduce our packaging
        waste significantly (though there is still more work to be done). We
        also made other lifestyle changes, like eating vegan as much as
        possible, reducing our consumption generally, and choosing walking,
        biking, and public transportation over modern conveniences like Uber.

        Our goal for this blog is not to change your mind about how to live your
        life, but rather to provide you with our example and give you tools to
        make lifestyle changes that make sense for you while living in London.
