      <h2>What is Zero-Waste?</h2>
      <p>The Zero-Waste movement seeks to reduce waste in all facets of life,
        ranging from literal physical waste (e.g. rubbish) to wasted time and
        wasted money.  This philosophy can be applied to individuals, families,
        and businesses and the most well-known guidebook is Bea Johnson's
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2qlfa6C" target="_blank">Zero-Waste Home</a>.
        The concept is fairly well-known, but can also seem overwhelming for
        some, especially for busy people living in a city like London.

        We are here to help.  The purpose of this blog is to help you take the
        <em>steps that make sense for you</em> to move towards reducing waste
        in your own life.

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>You can think of this lifestyle change as a series of complimentary
        steps.  Say, for instance, that you don't have a good picture in what
        your everyday waste looks like.  Try for <em>just one day</em> to save
        any waste and look at it at the end of the day.  This means that if you
        buy a coffee for takeaway, save the cup.  If you use pre-chopped veg
        from M&S, save the container.  At the end of the day, take a look at
        what has accumulated.  What seems unecessary for you?  A good first step
        could be, for instance, using a reusable mug, or carrying a resuable
        water bottle.  For someone else, it might mean visiting a produce shop
        once a week and spending an hour on the weekend chopping vegetables
        to use the rest of the week.

        The transition to zero-waste does not need to happen all at once.
        Often just taking some time to think about your everyday decisions may
        inspire you to make changes that benefit both the planet and you wallet.
